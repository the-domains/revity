            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bon Marché, San Francisco, USA.</h1><p>Among the eateries revitalising San Francisco's once-gritty Mid-Market neighborhood into the city's most buzzy food and drinks corridor is Bon Marché, a sunny Californian take on Le Marais. This 7500-square-foot space combines a café, a brewery, an oyster bar, a full-service restaurant, and even a flower shop that doubles as a stage for live jazz at night.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f67536b56e8543128b8b1122f673dc5d50a01f50.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Clever Headrest That Could Make Flying Actually Bearable</h1><p>There are many reasons to hate flying economy. The tiny seats, the inedible food, the fees airlines charge for things you'd get for free in a medieval dungeon. Manon Kühne can't fix any of that, but she's has found one small way to make sitting in 17C just a bit less hellish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dc283ca637a9ed4e81f27749130ffccde596046.jpg"></article>]]></description>
